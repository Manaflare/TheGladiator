Ancient Roman Architecture
==========================

So, while the Romans typically took a lot of their architecture from Greece, they had perfected a few big things:

1. Arches! Perfectly round small arches, but still, big deal. [done]
2. Domes! They're arches, in 3D! [Done, this was the whole point of the ridiculous roof works stuff]
3. Concrete! This allowed them to build bigger arches and domes than the Greeks, who preffered to not even use mortar.
4. Waterworks.

Roman style is typified by it's geometric forms, much like the Greeks, but the Romans, just like the Greeks, or perhaps even more so, loved using plant and animal motives, while not as baroque(intricate and over the top) as the later Gothic, Byzantine and, well, Baroque, they certainly decorated their homes far more richly than the late 18th century neo-classicism and imperial styles would like you to think. (The latter styles taking on Greco-roman architectural paradigms because of their supossed simplicity)

Monumental
-----------

### Triumph arch
* Tuscan Order Columns [done]
* Roman Doric.
* Friezes [done]
* Casettes [done] (but they should be painting, really...)
* Statues [I only did Nike, because she was stuck onto everything by the Romans. Not doing the rest until I have found a satisfying style]

### Colloseum
* Rounded walls and rounded arches [partially done]


Outside:
--------
* Arches [done]
* Windows [done]
* Multiple walls with rotations [done]

I tried adapting the default red-brick house of the LPC base pack to fit along the other walls I made, partially for compatibility, and partially because those red-brick houses have a so-called egg-and-dart border at the top which is a famous decoration in Greco-Roman architecture.


Inside:
-----------
* Painted walls [done] (but they are not as gaudy as they should be, if Pompei ruins are any indication, my apologies)
* Mosaique [done]
* Amphora holders [done]
* Benches
* X-chairs [done]
* beds [done]
* Chests [done] Not sure if they're right.
* three-footed chair [done]

Waterworks:
-----------

### Aquaduct

* Walls [done]
* Arches [done]
* Water in channels [done]
* diagonals [done]



### Bath house
* Diocletian Window [I did some... but they're actually too tiny]
* Brick walls [done, but looks ugly]
* Water... [done]

### Fountain
Not gonna tackle this now.
