#TEXT_TUTORIAL_1		Okay! Now listen here- I own you.\nHere's the rules:\nYou fight, I get money, and if you don't die you get your freedom... maybe...
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_2		What? You don't like it?\nWell, next time don't get caught stealing.\nHere let's make a deal, if you can make it all the way to the top, I will give you your freedom.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_3		Since you will be here for the next while,\nlet me show you around.\n\nJust follow the signs.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_4		Guild -> You can do some extra work and earn some gold\n\nTakes time and stamina. 
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_5		Smith -> You can buy equipment here. You'll have to spend your own funds; whether you win or lose I get money.\n\nTakes time and gold.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_6		Home -> You can rest and recover stamina and health.\n\nTakes time to use it.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_7		Train -> You choose what skills you want to improve and your senior will teach you.\n\nTakes time and stamina.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_8		Spy -> Better safe than sorry. The Local Eyes will give up some of their information on the fighters, for a small fee.\n\nTakes gold and time.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_9		As you should realise by now, you have 3 main resources to manage: Time, Stamina and Gold.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_10		Time -> Almost every action you takes time to complete.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_11		Gold -> Mostly to buy better equipment and improve stats. Obtained from performing at the arena or from guildwork.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_12		Stamina -> Required to do Work or to Train.\nAdditionally, Stamina affects your performance\nin the Arena.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_13		And finally...\nArena -> Every Sunday you will battle against several enemies until you manage to beat your current tier\nYou can skip to Sunday and advance to battle.
#TEXT_TUTORIAL_14		I know, I know... Too much info, but I promise it is not that bad.\nNow, get out of here and go train!

#TEXT_ENDING_1		Wow... I can't believe you did it.
#TEXT_ENDING_2		You're no ordinary thief, are you? Something of legends, maybe?\nYou know, if I hadn't gotten half the money from this, I'd doubt it ever happened.
#TEXT_ENDING_3		Oh, yeah, your freedom..\nWell... You are the best gladiator I ever had...\nWhat if...
#TEXT_ENDING_4		Ah- nevermind!\nNow get out of here before I change my mind.
